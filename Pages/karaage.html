            <h4>Description</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              When we talk about the greatest fried chicken recipes of all time,
              karaage has to be at or near the top of that list. This
              Japanese-style fried chicken is crispy, juicy, and intensely
              flavorful, which is even more impressive when you consider the
              fact that there is no skin or bones involved. However, not all
              karaage recipes are created equal, and the awesomeness is very
              much dependent on how and what you coat your chicken pieces in.
              For me, that's pure potato starch. While I'm not known for my
              extensive, and exhaustive, recipe testing, I did many, many tests
              and experiments, using pretty much every possible combination of
              starch options; wheat flour, rice flour, cornstarch, et al., and
              potato starch was the winner. By the way, do not accidently buy
              potato flour, which is not the same thing, and will not work the
              same. If you can't find potato starch, which you can, I think
              cornstarch is the next best option. Above and beyond the coating
              starch, the marinade also varies from recipe to recipe, but most
              contain what I've used here, give or take a splash of mirin, and
              you shouldn't hesitate to experiment with different ratios. No
              matter what you use, I think a 2-3 hours marinade is perfect, but
              like I said in the video, anywhere from 1 to 10 hours is
              considered appropriate. No matter how long your soak, I hope you
              find some potato starch, and give this incredible fried chicken a
              try soon. Enjoy!

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
              <li>3 tablespoons sake</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
              <li>⅛ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
              <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
              <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
              <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
              <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
              <li>
                1 ¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2-inch
                pieces
              </li>
              <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
              <li>1 quart canola oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Mix garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sesame oil, black
                pepper, cayenne, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place chicken in the marinade and mix until thoroughly and
                evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 10 hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up your dredging station: Place a wire rack over a
                foil-lined baking sheet. Add potato starch to a wide, shallow
                bowl.
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Stir to coat with
                marinade. Toss 2 or 3 pieces at a time in the potato starch
                until evenly coated. Shake off any excess starch and place
                chicken on the wire rack. Repeat to dredge remaining pieces.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tap the rack on the baking sheet to remove any loose chunks of
                starch, then transfer the baking sheet and rack of chicken to
                the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
              </li>
              <li>
                Without crowding, lower chicken carefully into the hot oil in
                batches. Fry, tossing occasionally, until cooked through and the
                outside is crunchy and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a
                paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken.
